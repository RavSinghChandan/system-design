## 🚀 **What is System Design?**
System design involves creating the architecture of software systems to handle specific functionalities while meeting scalability, reliability, and maintainability requirements. Design patterns are essential building blocks in this process, offering reusable solutions to common problems.

## 📂 **Repository Content**
Here's what you will find in this repository:

### 📘 **Design Pattern Categories**
1. **Creational Patterns**: Focus on object creation mechanisms, improving flexibility and reuse of code.
    - Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.

2. **Structural Patterns**: Deal with the composition of objects and classes to form larger structures.
    - Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Proxy, Flyweight.

3. **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on communication between objects and how they interact.
    - Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, Iterator, Chain of Responsibility, Template Method, State.

### 🛠️ **Practical Code Examples**
Each pattern includes:
- **Problem Statement**: Explains the issue the pattern solves.
- **Code Implementation**: Hands-on examples with clear explanations.
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications for the pattern.
