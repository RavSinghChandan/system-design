# Memento Design Pattern

---

## 🔎 Introduction

The **Memento Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. It is often used in scenarios where undo or rollback functionality is required. The pattern is based on three primary roles: the Originator, the Memento, and the Caretaker.

---

## ❓ What is the Memento Pattern?

- The Memento Pattern captures and externalizes an object’s internal state.
- It allows restoring the object to this state later without violating encapsulation.
- It defines three main components:
    - **Originator**: The object whose state needs to be saved or restored.
    - **Memento**: The object that stores the state of the Originator.
    - **Caretaker**: The object that requests and stores Mementos.

---

## 🤔 Why use the Memento Pattern?

- 🔄 **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Enables rollback to a previous state.
- 🔒 **Encapsulation**: Maintains object integrity by not exposing internal details.
- 🔧 **Simplifies State Management**: Useful in applications with complex state transitions.

---

## ⏰ When to use the Memento Pattern?

- When you need to implement undo/redo functionality.
- When restoring a previous state is essential for user actions.
- When the state of an object changes frequently and must be saved periodically.

---

## 📍 Where to use the Memento Pattern?

- **Text Editors**: Implementing undo/redo features.
- **Game Development**: Saving game progress and checkpoints.
- **Database Transactions**: Supporting rollback of changes.
- **State Management**: Managing state changes in applications.
- **Version Control Systems**: Maintaining different versions of a document or file.

---

## ⚙️ How does the Memento Pattern work?

1. **Originator**: Creates a memento to store its state and restores state from memento.
2. **Memento**: A value object that acts as a snapshot of the Originator’s state.
3. **Caretaker**: Manages the mementos and interacts with the Originator to save or restore states.

---

## 👥 Who should use the Memento Pattern?

- Developers building applications with undo/redo functionality.
- Systems requiring rollback of changes.
- Projects where state transitions need to be tracked and managed.

---

## ✅ Advantages

- 📚 **State Restoration**: Easily restore previous states.
- 🛠️ **Encapsulation**: No need to expose object internals.
- ♻️ **Flexible State Management**: Simplifies state-saving logic.

---

## ❌ Disadvantages

- 🚧 **Memory Overhead**: Storing multiple states can be costly.
- 🔧 **Complexity**: Requires careful management of mementos.
