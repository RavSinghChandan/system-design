# Visitor Design Pattern

---

## 🔎 Introduction

The **Visitor Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows adding new operations to a set of objects without modifying their structure. It achieves this by using a visitor object that implements the operation, enabling it to operate on objects of different classes.

---

## ❓ What is the Visitor Pattern?
- The Visitor Pattern separates an algorithm from the objects it operates on.
- It involves creating a visitor class that changes the executing algorithm based on the class of the object it visits.
- The pattern enables operations to be added without altering the object structure.

---

## 🤔 Why use the Visitor Pattern?
- 🏗️ **Extensibility**: Easily add new operations without modifying existing code.
- 📦 **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the logic of operations separate from the object structure.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Operations**: Provides flexibility to define operations independently.

---

## ⏰ When to use the Visitor Pattern?
- When you need to perform operations on an object structure without modifying the objects.
- When the object structure rarely changes, but new operations are often required.
- When operations need to be defined independently of the objects they work on.

## 📍 Where to use the Visitor Pattern?

1. **Compilers**: Syntax tree traversal and operations like optimization or code generation.
2. **Graphics Applications**: Rendering or applying transformations to graphical objects.
3. **File Systems**: Traversing file structures to apply operations (e.g., compressing files).
4. **E-commerce**: Calculating discounts or applying rules to shopping cart items.
5. **Database Operations**: Applying visitor operations to database schemas or records.
6. **Game Development**: Applying effects or logic to game elements like players or NPCs.
7. **Logging Systems**: Applying logging or monitoring operations dynamically.
8. **Payroll Systems**: Calculating bonuses, taxes, or other salary components for employees.
9. **Network Protocols**: Handling packets or requests in a structured manner.
10. **Insurance Systems**: Calculating premiums or evaluating claims.

## ⚙️ How does the Visitor Pattern work?

1. **Visitor Interface**: Declares a `visit` method for each object type.
2. **Concrete Visitor**: Implements the operations for each object type.
3. **Element Interface**: Declares an `accept` method that takes a visitor object.
4. **Concrete Elements**: Implement the `accept` method and allow the visitor to perform an operation.
5. **Client**: Creates the visitor and passes it to the elements.

## 👥 Who should use the Visitor Pattern?
- Developers working on systems with stable object structures but dynamic operations.
- Teams designing applications requiring new functionality frequently.
- Architects needing to decouple logic from data structures.

---

## ✅ Advantages
- 🚀 **Open/Closed Principle**: New operations can be added without modifying existing code.
- 🔍 **Centralized Logic**: Visitor classes centralize related operations.
- 🛠️ **Flexibility**: Supports multiple unrelated operations on the same object structure.

---

## ❌ Disadvantages
- 🏗️ **Complexity**: Adding a visitor for many element types can lead to a large number of methods.
- 🔒 **Dependency**: Requires all elements to expose their structure to the visitor.
