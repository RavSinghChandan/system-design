# 🔍 Brute Force Techniques

## **🔎 Introduction**

Brute force techniques are fundamental problem-solving methods that involve systematically exploring all possible solutions to find the correct one. While often less efficient than optimized methods, brute force serves as a straightforward and universal approach to tackling a wide range of problems.
