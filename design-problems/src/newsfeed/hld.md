# üì∞ News Feed System - High-Level Design (HLD)

## üèóÔ∏è System Overview

The News Feed System is a dynamic platform where users can post content, follow others, view personalized feeds, and interact with content through likes and comments. It leverages microservices architecture for scalability and flexibility, ensuring real-time updates and efficient content delivery.

## üîß System Components

### 1. **User Management Service**
- **Responsibility**: Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- **Key Features**:
    - User Registration and Authentication
    - User Profile Management
- **Interactions**:
    - Receives user data from frontend (Angular) for registration.
    - Provides JWT token for authenticated sessions.

### 2. **Post Management Service**
- **Responsibility**: Handles creation, retrieval, and management of posts.
- **Key Features**:
    - Post creation and storage
    - Content retrieval
    - Post deletion and updates
- **Interactions**:
    - Receives post data from authenticated users.
    - Communicates with the database for post storage and retrieval.

### 3. **Feed Generation Service**
- **Responsibility**: Generates personalized news feeds for users.
- **Key Features**:
    - Feed ranking algorithms
    - User-specific content delivery based on interests and interactions
- **Interactions**:
    - Pulls posts from the Post Management Service.
    - Uses a ranking algorithm to prioritize content (e.g., recent-first, engagement-based).

### 4. **Interaction Service**
- **Responsibility**: Handles interactions like likes, comments, and shares on posts.
- **Key Features**:
    - Like and comment functionality
    - Tracks user engagement on posts
- **Interactions**:
    - Updates post data with likes and comments.
    - Sends notifications to post creators for interactions.

### 5. **Follow Management Service**
- **Responsibility**: Manages following relationships between users.
- **Key Features**:
    - Allows users to follow/unfollow others
    - Tracks followers and followees
- **Interactions**:
    - Updates user‚Äôs follower/following list in the database.
    - Notifies users about new followers.

### 6. **Notification Service**
- **Responsibility**: Sends notifications to users for various activities like post interactions, new followers, etc.
- **Key Features**:
    - Real-time notifications for likes, comments, and follows
    - Custom notification preferences
- **Interactions**:
    - Subscribes to activities like new follows or post interactions and delivers notifications to users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Flow

### 1. **User Registration & Authentication**
- Users register and authenticate via the **User Management Service**.
- On successful login, the frontend stores the JWT token for session management.

### 2. **Post Creation**
- Users submit posts through the **Post Management Service**.
- The backend validates and stores the post, making it available for users to view.

### 3. **Feed Generation**
- When users view their feed, the **Feed Generation Service** compiles personalized posts based on the users‚Äô following list and engagement.
- The system uses ranking algorithms to determine which posts should appear first.

### 4. **Interaction (Like/Comment)**
- Users interact with posts by liking or commenting, which triggers updates to the **Post Management Service**.
- The **Interaction Service** tracks these interactions and updates engagement data.

### 5. **Follow/Unfollow**
- When a user follows or unfollows another user, the **Follow Management Service** updates the relationship.
- Users receive notifications based on their follow activity.

### 6. **Notifications**
- The **Notification Service** generates real-time notifications for users based on their activities (likes, comments, follows).
- Notifications are delivered via various channels (e.g., in-app, email).

## üåê API Endpoints

### **User Management Service**
- `POST /api/users/register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /api/users/login`: User login and JWT token generation.

### **Post Management Service**
- `POST /api/posts`: Create a new post.
- `GET /api/posts/{id}`: Get a specific post.
- `GET /api/posts/feed/{userId}`: Get personalized feed for a user.

### **Follow Management Service**
- `POST /api/follow`: Follow a user.
- `DELETE /api/follow`: Unfollow a user.

### **Interaction Service**
- `POST /api/posts/{postId}/like`: Like a post.
- `POST /api/posts/{postId}/comment`: Comment on a post.

### **Notification Service**
- `GET /api/notifications/{userId}`: Get notifications for a user.
- `POST /api/notifications/{userId}`: Send notifications to a user.

## üîê Security & Authentication

- **JWT Authentication**: Ensures secure user authentication and session management.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensures users can only access appropriate data and services.

---

## üå± Scalability & Performance Considerations

- **Microservices**: Each service (User, Post, Feed, Interaction, etc.) is independently scalable.
- **Caching**: Redis is used to cache popular content (e.g., news feeds) for faster access.
- **Message Queue**: Kafka is employed for asynchronous processing, especially for notifications.

---

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Feed Updates**: Implement WebSockets for live feed updates.
- **Advanced Content Moderation**: Integrate AI tools for flagging inappropriate content.
- **Support for Multimedia**: Extend the system to support images, videos, and other media types in posts.
