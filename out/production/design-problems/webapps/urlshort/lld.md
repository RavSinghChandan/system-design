### **URLShorteningService**

#### Methods:

- **shortenURL(String longUrl)**:
    - **Purpose**: Takes a long URL and returns a short URL.
    - **Logic**:
        - If the URL has already been shortened, return the existing short URL.
        - If not, generate a new 6-character short URL and store the mapping.
    - **Input**: `longUrl` (String).
    - **Output**: Shortened URL (String).

- **getOriginalURL(String shortUrl)**:
    - **Purpose**: Takes a short URL and returns the original long URL.
    - **Logic**: Extracts the short code from the URL and retrieves the corresponding long URL from `shortToLongMap`.
    - **Input**: `shortUrl` (String).
    - **Output**: Original long URL (String).

- **generateShortCode()**:
    - **Purpose**: Generates a random 6-character code from a predefined set of characters.
    - **Logic**: Randomly selects characters from the `CHARACTERS` string and constructs the short URL code.
    - **Input**: None.
    - **Output**: Randomly generated 6-character string.
