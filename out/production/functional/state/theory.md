# State Design Pattern

---

## 🔎 Introduction

The **State Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It helps in managing state-dependent behavior by encapsulating state-specific logic into separate classes.

---

## ❓ What is the State Pattern?

- The State Pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior and transitions in separate state classes.
- It allows an object to appear as if its class has changed when the state changes.
- Key Components:
    - **Context**: Maintains the current state and delegates behavior to the state object.
    - **State Interface**: Defines the behavior for each state.
    - **Concrete States**: Implement the behavior associated with the state.

---

## 🤔 Why use the State Pattern?

- 🔄 **Dynamic Behavior**: Enables an object to change behavior dynamically.
- 📉 **Simplified Code**: Eliminates complex conditional statements for state management.
- 🔧 **Maintainability**: Isolates state-specific behavior into separate classes.

---

## ⏰ When to use the State Pattern?

- When an object’s behavior depends on its state and changes dynamically.
- When you need to avoid complex conditionals or switch-case statements.
- When state-specific behavior needs to be encapsulated for clarity and maintainability.

## 📍 Where to use the State Pattern?

- **Game Development**: Managing character states like idle, running, or attacking.
- **UI Components**: Handling states like enabled, disabled, or loading.
- **ATMs**: Representing states like idle, transaction, or out of service.
- **Document Workflow**: Managing states like draft, review, or published.
- **Traffic Lights**: Controlling light transitions (red, yellow, green).

## ⚙️ How does the State Pattern work?

1. **State Interface**: Defines the behavior for each state.
2. **Concrete State**: Implements the behavior associated with the state.
3. **Context**: Maintains a reference to the current state and delegates behavior to it.

---

## 👥 Who should use the State Pattern?

- Developers working on systems with multiple states and transitions.
- Systems requiring clear separation of state-specific logic.
- Projects aiming to simplify and modularize state management.

---

## ✅ Advantages

- 🔔 **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates state-specific behavior in dedicated classes.
- 🔄 **Flexibility**: Allows adding new states without modifying existing ones.
- 📚 **Clarity**: Simplifies the context class by delegating state-specific behavior.

---

## ❌ Disadvantages

- 🚧 **Complexity**: Increases the number of classes.
- 🔧 **Overhead**: Managing multiple state classes can add overhead.
